Start the machine and wait till it boot
now 1st thing use enumeration i.e. use "nmap" and find the running port on the target machine
we get there is 7 service running 
and one of them is smb 

# smb>> samba share it port no is 139,445 
  we can enumerate smb manually and automatically ["enum4linux"]
  here we are using manually ["smbclient"]["nmap" -script]["smbget" -R]
  through nmap we come to know about the smb share and smb user
  after getting the result 
  through smbclient we found the log file which tell us the about id_rsa	next port
  FTP is running and port no for ftp is 21
  enumarating through [nmap -script nfs]
  we know that it is sharing one file 
  {we also find this by not using nmap i.e["showmount -a <ip>"]}
  after getting the result we found that one of the port is running ""proftpd"tool" so we expoited it by SITE CPFR and CPTO 
  here basically we are trying to get id_rsa key form the target machine
  we loaded the FTP by netcat "nc <ip> <port>"
  we have to get the id_rsa file so "mount" the file 
  [means if we mount the file then we will be able to transfer file or change file with target using our file system]
  get the id_rsa by nfs "mount"
  now use ssh 
  we have to make the key unexecutable to work
  
  
  task 4
  privilege escalation
  use the "find" command to get the sbit in the target
  here we can see that the file /usr/bin/menu is not using a full binary path 
  i.e bin/sh 
  now change the chmod 
  and run the command I.e menu 
  and you got root
